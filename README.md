# SynthesizerTrial
My first attempt at creating a synthesizer using the JUCE framework. 

I am starting this project from following along with the "audio plugin demo" included with JUCE (in the examples folder). I'm using the more updated "audio plugin demo" that's located in the JUCE GitHub repository. This newer version uses the somewhat recent AudioProcessorParameter class for handling parameters in plugins so following along with this demo is the best way to learn how this new class works. By the way, the old way of handling parameters is going to eventually be deprecated, so that should be considered.
